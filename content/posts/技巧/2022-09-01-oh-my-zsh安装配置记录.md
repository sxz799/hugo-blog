[官网地址](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## 安装

安装命令(二者均可)：  

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```


## 环境变量失效？
将`~/.bash_profile`文件中的变量复制到`~/.zshrc`目录
macos下如果你之前用的是zsh 就将`~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`文件中的变量复制到`~/.zshrc`目录即可

## 修改主题
```
//   ~/.zshrc

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

## 插件
常用的两个插件
### **zsh-autosuggestions**
自动建议补全
安装命令
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```
### **zsh-syntax-highlighting**
语法高亮插件
安装命令
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

安装好以后启用插件,也是在~/.zshrc中配置
```go
//   ~/.zshrc
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git z zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

刚安装好以后应该是只有一个git,后门两个是刚才下载的  
z是自带插件，可以历史目录记录

配置好以后使用下面命令更新配置
```
source ~/.zshrc
```
